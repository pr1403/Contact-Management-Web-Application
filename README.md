## Contact Management Web Application   

**Objective:** Built a dynamic web application to manage and update personal/professional contact information.  

**Approach:**  
- Developed a responsive **React frontend** with modal-based forms and real-time re-rendering.  
- Implemented **full CRUD functionality** through Flask API endpoints, tested on a local development server.  
- Integrated **SQLAlchemy** with a local SQLite database for contact creation, updates, and deletions.  
- Enabled **inline note editing** and real-time UI updates using `fetch`, `PATCH` requests, and re-fetching logic.  

**Impact:** Streamlined digital contact management by providing intuitive in-browser editing and information tracking.
